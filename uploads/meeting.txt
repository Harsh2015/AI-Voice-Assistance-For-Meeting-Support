Good morning everyone. Today’s meeting is about the progress of our e-commerce project. 
The development team has completed the user authentication module and integrated payment gateways. 
However, there are still some issues with cart synchronization on mobile devices that need to be fixed. 
The marketing team reported a positive response from early social media campaigns and suggested increasing ad spending next month. 
For customer support, we are planning to add a chatbot to handle common FAQs and reduce ticket load. 
The next deadline is two weeks from now, and we need to complete mobile optimization and security testing before launch.
